      "The <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21097/\" target=\"_blank\"> NCBI Tutorial</a> contains an introduction to the basics of BLAST, covering the general approach, the alignment algorithm, how to quantify the comparison of sequences,the insertion of gaps, the statistical aspect of searching and the databases involved.  Key to BLAST's success, both as an algorithm and as a program, has been its use of statistical methods to simultaneously accelerate its search speed and to increase its search sensitivity. In the late 1980's and early 1990's, Altschul and Karlin showed that the significance of pairwise sequence alignments could be rapidly determined or in essence, \"predicted\" using what is called an Extreme Value Distribution. By using this special kind of Poisson distribution and the probabilities that could be calculated from it, Altschul and co-workers demonstrated that it was possible to rapidly identify, assess and extend local sequence blocks or k-tuples more rapidly and more accurately than FASTA or other competing programs.  In class we will go over the tutorial and the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK62051/\" target=\"_blank\">Glossary of BLAST TERMS</a>\n",

      "### Similarity vs. Identity\n",
      "\n",
      "When protein sequences are aligned, the amino acids at a particular position in the aligment are often said to be identical if they are identical and similar if the amino acids have similar biochemical properties.  For example in the BLAST results below, the V to I comparison is marked by a \"+\".  If you look at the above chart on the biochemical characteristics of proteins both V (valine) and I (Isolecine) are nonpolar neutral amino acids.  Thus, they often can be exchanged in a protein sequence without affecting the protein function.  Protein sequences are often compared based on the % identity which is the fraction of amino acids that are identical in an alignment and the % similarity which is the fraction of similar amino acids.  In the BLAST results the % similarity is the \"Positives\".\n",
